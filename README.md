# Project Socrates â€” AI Socratic Dialogue Tutor (Rewritten)

Project Socrates is a lightweight educational system that simulates Socratic dialogue to teach critical thinking.
It guides students through open-ended topics by asking adaptive, context-aware questions, detecting logical gaps
or fallacies, and building a structured "reasoning trace" of the interaction.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
streamlit run app.py
```
